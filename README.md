# ES-LM

## Descriptions
The Levenberg-Marquardt based iterative Ensemble Smoother (ES-LM) belongs to the family of iterative Ensemble Smoother (iES) methods, which are widely used for history matching and uncertainty quantification in groundwater hydrology. The ES-LM method is developed by Ma and Bi (2019) and implemented by Yang et al. (2023). This repository provides python codes for the ES-LM and examples of its implementation of inverse modeling.
