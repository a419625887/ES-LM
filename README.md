# ES-LM

## Descriptions
The Levenberg-Marquardt based iterative Ensemble Smoother (ES-LM) belongs to the family of iterative Ensemble Smoother (iES) methods, which are widely used for history matching and uncertainty quantification in groundwater hydrology. The ES-LM method is developed by Ma and Bi (2019) and implemented by Yang et al. (2023). This repository provides python codes for the ES-LM and examples of its implementation of inverse modeling.

## Requirements


## Examples
`Example1` demonstrates the application of ES-LM to fit a quadratic curve given scatter data. `Example2` demonstrates the application of ES-LM to calibrate a 2D groundwater model. Python codes and data for these examples are provided in respective folders. Implementation of the ES-LM codes are explained in the python script of each example. To run these examples, the module `/Source/IES_lib.py` needs to be copied to the work directory.
